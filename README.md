## Business Problem
The financial services industry's ecosystem is dynamic and multidimensional, characterized by a complex interplay of factors that influence consumer behaviors. In this complex environment, the ability to retain customers is more than a strategic advantage; it is a requirement for long-term growth and sustainability. The inherent challenges of customer attrition for financial institutions include substantial revenue loss and the erosion of brand loyalty.

As a result, a Canadian bank facing challenges in retaining its customer base reached out to Datafied Technologies. The bank is experiencing customer churn, impacting overall customer satisfaction and revenue, as well as they lack insights into the factors influencing customer decisions to leave or stay with the bank. There is a need to identify and address factors contributing to customer churn proactively and to do that, they provided a churn database containing information on 10,000 bank customers over six months. 

## Dataset Information
This dataset is built from an initial dataset consisting of customers information from a canadian bank in the last 6 months indicating the CustomerID, Surname, Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of Product, Has Credit Card, Is Active Member, Estimated Salary and Churned.

In a bid to get additional outputs, additional columns were created using conditional columns an Replace Values. These columns include Age Categories, Numeric Age Condition, Account Balance Category, Credit Score Category, Numeric Credit Score Category and Numeric Account Balance Category.
